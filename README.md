# ðŸ—• GitHub Contribution Calendar â€” Fixed Version

This is a refined version of the GitHub-style contribution calendar built using React and the GitHub GraphQL API. It corrects a key UX issue found in the original version and improves the onboarding experience for users.

## What Was Wrong in the Original?

In the original implementation:

- Switching years (e.g. 2023 to 2024) added new entries to the browser history.
- This meant clicking the back button didnâ€™t immediately take you back â€” you'd have to press it multiple times just to leave the page.
- The calendar triggered a full page reload on each year switch, breaking the smooth single-page experience.
- The month labels above the contribution calendar were misaligned, especially when months didnâ€™t start at the beginning of a week.


## Whatâ€™s Fixed Here

- **Browser History Clean-up & no unnecessary re-renders**: Year selection now updates the calendar without altering browser history or triggering unnecessary page navigations.
